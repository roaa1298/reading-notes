## Packages and Import  
- Package = directory.  
- Java classes can be grouped together in packages.
- A package name is the same as the directory (folder) name which contains the .java files.   
-  Package declaration - after the declaration, you may add import lines that enable you to specify classes from other packages.  
-  A package that does not include a package declaration is known as a default package.  
-  Statement order in package declaration syntax, statement about the package, Imports, Definitions of classes and interfaces  
-  Three alternatives for imports The JOptionPane class may be found in the swing package, which is in the javax package. The wildcard character (*) indicates that your    application has access to all classes in that package. Instead of utilizing the wildcard character, classes can be specified directly during import. It is possible to    utilize a class name without importing it.
-  In programming languages, looping is a feature that allows a series of instructions to be executed until the controlling Boolean expression evaluates to false. Loops    of many types By incrementing and evaluating a loop counter, the for loop allows you to repeat specific processes. While loop - repeats a statement or a block of    statements while the Boolean expression controlling it is true.
