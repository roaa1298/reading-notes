### Difference between object and class

The difference between a class and an object is that a class is a logical entity and an object is a physical thing. In Java, the "class" keyword may be used to create a class, whereas the "new" keyword can be used to create an object. A class, on the other hand, does not allocate memory space; on the other hand, an object does.
### Declaring variables

A class's member variables are referred to as fields. Local variables are variables within a method or a block of code. Parameters are variables that appear in method declarations.
### Provide Constructor to Class

The constructor of the class may be used to build objects from the class blueprint. I may give information to a constructor or method as arguments, but I must define the type of data I'm giving. The varargs technique allows the user to supply an arbitrary value to a method.
### Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers

There is a decimal point in decimals that helps us understand the location of a number. The decimal number system is known as Base 10 since it is based on the number 10. And the digits 0 to 9 are “symbols.”
