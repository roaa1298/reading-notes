# Hash Tables
- Hash tables are a data structure that store the data as key and value pairs, By using that key you can access the elements faster. Using the key, the algorithm (hash function) computes an index that suggests where an entry can be found or inserted.  
- The key is converted into an integer by using a hash function. This integer number can be used as an index to store the original element, which falls into the hash table.  
- Collisions: A collision occurs when more than one key hashes to the same index in an array. Collisions are solved by chaining, It is usually implemented using linked lists (each element of the hash table is a linked list).  
- There is something called Buckets in the hash tables. Each index of the array of the hashtable is a bucket. An index could potentially contain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs. this bucket may be another data structure to hold the elements like linked list or tree or set and so on.  
- We gives a (key, value) pair set as input, and based on the value generated by the hash function an index is generated to where the value corresponding to the particular key is stored. So whenever we need to fetch a value corresponding to a key, that is just O(1).

- Now what we do is make a linked list corresponding to the particular bucket of the Hash Table, to accommodate all the values corresponding to different keys that map to the same bucket.   
- Now there may be a scenario that all the keys get mapped to the same bucket, and we have a linked list of n(size of the hash table) size from one single bucket, with all the other buckets empty and this is the worst case where a hash table acts a linked list and searching is O(n).  

## Implementation 
- **get(K key)** : returns the value corresponding to the key if the key is present in Hast Table. The get function just takes a key as an input and returns the corresponding value if the key is present in the table otherwise returns null. Steps are:  
   - Retrieve the input key to find the index in the Hast Table.  
   - Traverse the linked list corresponding to the Hast Table if you find the value then return it else if you fully traverse the list without returning it means the value is not present in the table and can’t be fetched so return null.  

- **getSize()** : return the size of the Hast Table.
- **add()** : adds new valid key, value pair to the Hast Table, if already present updates the value. 
   - Fetch the index corresponding to the input key using the hash function.
   - Once you determine the index of where it should be placed, go to that index.  
   - Check if something exists at that index already, if it doesn’t, add it with the key/value pair.  
   - If something does exist, add the new key/value pair to the data structure within that bucket.  

- The **hash** Function is implemented to get the index of the key, to avoid redundancy in other functions like get, add and remove. This function uses the inbuilt java function to generate a hash code, and we compress the hash code by the size of the Hast Table so that the index is within the range of the size of the Hast Table.  
- **isEmpty()** : returns true if size is zero.
- **remove()** : removes the key, value pair.
